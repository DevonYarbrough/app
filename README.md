# Kickback Dapp

- Dev version: https://dev.kickback.events
- Live version: https://kickback.events

## Dev guide

**Install dep**

```shell
yarn
```

**Start a local test network**

In a new terminal:

```shell
npx ganache-cli
```

**Clone our backend repo**

Clone the [backend repo](https://githbu.com/noblocknoparty/server) into a
sibling folder called `server` such that directory structure is as follows:

```shell
/my/path
  /my/path/server    <- backend repo
  /my/path/app    <- app repo (this project)
```

Follow the instructions in the `server` repo README to get the server up and
running locally.

**Deploy our Deployer contract to local test network**

Clone the [contracts repo](https://github.com/noblocknoparty/contracts) into a
sibling folder called `contracts` such that
directory structure is as follows:

```shell
/my/path
  /my/path/contracts    <- contracts repo
  /my/path/server    <- backend repo
  /my/path/app    <- app repo (this project)
```

Follow the instructions in the `contracts` repo README to get contracts
compilation and deployment working, ensuring that you run the following command
within it:

```shell
yarn deploy:local
```

_Note: This will update both this project and the backend repo project to have
the right deployer address_.

**Run the backend server**

Go back into the server repo folder and re-run the server. Now let's ensure
that the frontend app will speak to the server instance running locally.

Edit `src/config/env.js` and enter the `API_URL` key:

```js
{
  ...
  "API_KEY": "http://localhost:3001",
  ...
}
```

**Run the app**

Run the dev server:

```
yarn start
```

**Test creating a event locally**

- Go to http://localhost:3000/create
- Open inspector on your browser
- Fill in event detail and press "Submit"
- Once transaction is complete, then get `deployedAddress` from the event.
- Go to http://localhost:3000/party/$address to see if newly created event is shown.
